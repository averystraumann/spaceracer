simple platformer made in unity with a 2D core!!

all art & code done by me :D

to run the game:
download the build-1.0.zip file, and unzip the contents. run the untitled platformer.exe file, and the game should start running! the build is made for windows, ios, and linux so hopefully it works on all of those systems, but this is my first time really using unity so let me know if there are any issues!
have fun! :D
