simple platformer made in unity with a 2D core!!

code is done in c#, art done in aseprite

to run the game:
download the build-1.0.zip file, and unzip the contents. run the untitled platformer.exe file, and the game should start running! when you try to run the exe you might get a windows protection popup, but i promise i am not going to give you a virus ;)  the build is made for windows, ios, and linux so hopefully it works on all of those systems, but this is my first time really using unity so let me know if there are any issues!
have fun! :D
